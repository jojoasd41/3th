"1. From what I have learned, different locations breed different surroundings. Human ancestors were migratory pack animals. Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time.   2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures. Some mutations also occured etc. Things like that.   Evolution doesn't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium. Not everyting is always changing, as far as I learned. Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.   Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example.

"Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws.

However, the use of ""sounds like the whole 'proof' is pointless,"" coupled with skepticism about the argument itself, suggests underlying sarcasm.

**Step 2:** Analyzing the intention behind the words, the speaker shows skepticism about a philosophical proof regarding God's existence. The mocking tone in phrases such as ""presumptuous"" and ""the proof works"" suggests that the speaker is not genuinely impressed but rather highlighting the flaws in the reasoning.

The text displays a negative sentiment, primarily through the use of critical phrases like ""you murder the English language"" and the vehement rejection of the idea of incubating something ""because someone who may or may not exist said so."" The use of strong language and dramatic dismissal conveys disdain and mockery. 

### Step 2: True Intention
The speaker appears to be employing sarcasm to undermine the credibility of the person being addressed. By claiming that the other person has “no right to talk about murder” while feigning concern for morality, the speaker suggests that their argument is hypocritical. The extremes of the language (accusations of murder regarding language) along with the questioning of god's existence point to a disdainful critique of the beliefs and arguments presented. The amalgamation of irony, hyperbole, and mockery throughout the text indicates that this is not a sincere affirmation of the ideas discussed but rather a scathing dismissal intended to highlight the ridiculousness of the other person's assertions.

The change is not in the definition itself. It's in who it applies to.",0,"Step 1: The SURFACE sentiment of the text is neutral and logical. There are no clear keywords, sentimental phrases, or emojis indicating sarcasm. It focuses on clarifying misconceptions about marriage definitions.

Step 2: The TRUE intention of the sentence is to assert that expanding the definition of marriage to include more people does not diminish existing rights or protections.

The text contains negative language directed toward religion, using phrases like ""couldn't be any worse,"" ""religious fools,"" and ""the Spanish Inquisition."" The overall sentiment leans heavily toward criticism and disdain for religion, suggesting a negative viewpoint.

### Step 2: True Intention
The initial statements about the state of the world and the negative impacts of religion show a clear use of sarcasm. Phrases like ""couldn't be any worse"" suggest hyperbole, indicating that the writer does not genuinely believe that the current state is the worst imaginable. The use of terms like ""televangelists have become pimps"" and comparisons of religious figures to extremists further highlight a mocking and critical tone, rather than a straightforward critique. The reference to Hitler as a ""devout catholic"" is another attempt to undermine any positive image of religion. Overall, the structure and language convey an intention to mock, which points to sarcasm.

### Step 3: Voting and Final Judgment
All three agents evaluated the text and arrived at the same conclusion: it reflects a sarcastic critique of religion. Therefore, after analyzing the surface sentiment and the true intention along with the consistency in the agents' evaluations:

The initial reading of the text indicates a serious tone, predominantly focused on safety precautions. Key phrases such as ""fire extinguisher,"" ""self-defense,"" and ""seat belt"" suggest a pragmatic approach to risk management. There are no sarcastic phrases, emojis, or ambiguous language present.

**Step 2: True Intention**  
Upon deeper analysis, the text uses analogies (fire extinguisher to seat belt) to illustrate a serious perspective on safety. The language is straightforward, and there are no indications of irony or exaggeration that typically signal sarcasm. The overall intention appears to be genuinely advocating for the importance of safety measures, rather than mocking or belittling them.

Oh what a shame! Especially if it's true! Where did you get the idea that ID theory is not based on evidence and/or testing?,1,"Step 1: The SURFACE sentiment appears to be one of shame or disbelief, as indicated by the phrases ""Oh what a shame!"" and ""Where did you get the idea...?"" which convey a critical tone toward the notion of ID theory lacking evidence.

Step 2: The TRUE intention is likely sarcastic. The use of phrases such as ""Oh what a shame!"" suggests a mocking attitude rather than genuine concern. The rhetorical questioning format indicates that the speaker does not actually seek an answer, but instead ridicules the position that ID theory lacks evidence, using irony to emphasize the absurdity of that claim.

Step 3: All three Agents (Contextual, Semantic, and Rhetorical) have concluded that the statement is sarcastic. Accordingly, through their analyses and the strong signals of sarcasm present in the text, the final label is determined.

Brief summary: Sarcastically mocks ID theory's lack of evidence.

I have lots and lots of guns, right here at my house. Last year, the murder rate at my house was 0. I think that we can most likely maintain the same this year.   What school are you at?",1,"Step 1: The surface sentiment appears to be light and dismissive, indicated by phrases like ""most nonsensical"" and the claim of low murder rates at the speaker's home despite their gun ownership. 

Step 2: The true intention is highlighted by the use of irony and hyperbole. The speaker suggests that having many guns is safe, which contrasts with societal concerns about gun violence. The rhetorical question about the school implies skepticism about the fears surrounding guns, suggesting that the fear is overblown.

Step 3: All agents have arrived at the same conclusion, recognizing the sarcastic undertone in the statement. The final summary indicates irony regarding gun ownership safety, and the unanimous agreement leads to a final label.

Step 2: The TRUE intention appears to be sarcastic critique. The speaker is not genuinely expressing pity but is rather mocking the reluctance to debate and implying that the other person engages in dishonest tactics. The tone conveys contempt and challenges the person's intelligence.

Step 3: The final labels from Agents 1, 2, and 3 are all [1].

"Repeating superstitious nonsense makes it no less mythological than the first, second and third time you were shown it to be so. Skeletons, even from the BRONZE age, let alone your incorrect reference to the stone age, are not fossils.",1,"### Step 1:
The surface sentiment of the sentence includes keywords like ""Repeating superstitious nonsense"" and phrases such as ""incorrect reference"" and ""not fossils,"" which convey frustration and assertiveness. These clues suggest a serious critique rather than a light-hearted comment.

### Step 2:
The true intention behind the sentence indicates a strong condemnation of the misunderstanding surrounding myths, superstitions, and the scientific understanding of skeletons and fossils. The mention of ""superstitious nonsense"" implies that the author finds such beliefs utterly irrational, and the reference to historical periods (Bronze age, Stone age) indicates an attempt to correct ignorance. The overall construction of the argument suggests a desire to educate while emphasizing the absurdity of the misconception. However, Agent3 identifies an element of irony that contrasts the seriousness of the critique with a sarcastic edge aimed at belittling the ignorance behind the beliefs discussed.

Edit:   And just to address one other point, scientists are well aware of the limitations of the human eye.

The tone suggests criticism.

Step 2: The true intention behind the statement seems to be a sarcastic critique of the other person's tendency to exaggerate in arguments. The request for factual evidence further emphasizes the speaker's disbelief in the other person's assertions.

60% accepting Roe v Wade is a high figure don't you think? More people support abortion then the president.,1,"**Step 1:** The surface sentiment suggests a critical viewpoint on the public's support for Roe v. Wade, using the phrase ""60% accepting Roe v Wade is a high figure don’t you think?"" which could imply skepticism about that acceptance being surprising. The comparison to the president’s approval invokes a sense of irony.

**Step 2:** The true intention of the sentence seems to be highlighting a disparity between public support for a contentious issue (Roe v. Wade) and the approval rating of the president, potentially mocking the idea that such a figure (60%) is surprising or significant in a national conversation about abortion rights. The use of rhetorical questioning adds a layer of sarcasm to the commentary.

**Step 3:** 
- Agent 1 concluded that there is no sarcasm present.
- Agent 2 identified a sarcastic tone critiquing public sentiment.
- Agent 3 recognized irony in the statistical interpretation, suggesting sarcasm.

Maybe gay people would like to enjoy some of the happiness you get from your marriage and same as you that happiness is worth the oppressiveness incurred as a result.   You may have more in common with gay people than you think.,1,"Step 1: The surface sentiment includes phrases like ""collapse of our legal system"" and ""happiness you get from your marriage"", which seem to convey a critical and exaggerated perspective towards opponents of gay marriage. This suggests a negative sentiment towards the extreme positions against it.

Step 2: Analyzing the language, the speaker employs irony and hyperbole, especially in the extreme depiction of the consequences of legalizing gay marriage. The phrase ""you may have more in common with gay people than you think"" juxtaposes the opposition's views with a more inclusive message, making it clear that the intended meaning is to undermine the arguments against gay marriage. The overall tone is critical of those who hold homophobic views, suggesting that their reasoning is not only flawed but also absurd.

The surface sentiment of the text suggests frustration or annoyance regarding taxes and rights, particularly ""sin tax"" and the financial punishment tied to free expression. Keywords like ""fair,"" ""lying propaganda,"" and ""responsibilities"" hint at a deeper critique, indicating a possibly sarcastic tone.

### Step 2: True Intention
Analyzing the rhetorical devices present:
- **Hyperbole**: The suggestion of a $100 tax for logging on and $10 per word is exaggerated, indicating a mocking tone.
- **Irony**: The statement presents an extreme view of how to manage rights, suggesting a punitive nature for exercising free speech, which is contrary to the basic principles of those rights.

Words like ""expect them to argue positions that make sense"" imply a negative view of these individuals, indicating some irony.

**Step 2:** The true intention behind the statement seems to be sarcastic. The phrase ""Chalk it up to the fact that"" implies a dismissive attitude, and labeling the individuals as ""anti-anything education"" highlights a sense of absurdity regarding their logic. The nuance of ""not all the time"" suggests that while there may be exceptions, the overall pattern of these individuals’ behavior is largely consistent with incompetence in their arguments.

Keywords like ""ravenous"" and phrases that imply unlikeliness contribute to a humorous undertone.

**Step 2:** The true intention of the sentence is satirical, employing irony to contrast the gravity of Noah's Ark with the triviality of termites. The exaggeration regarding the Ark being unturned and the vivid imagery of termites consuming it serves to mock the seriousness of the original biblical account. 

**Step 3:** All three Agents unanimously categorize the text as sarcastic due to its clear use of absurdity, irony, and exaggeration. The voting results suggest a strong agreement that the work is satirical.

Phrases like ""hang on a minute"" create a light-hearted tone.

Step 2: The true intention seems to be questioning and mocking the simplistic distinction between two divine concepts of justice. The abrupt transition between the ""Age of Law"" and the ""Age of Grace"" indicates that the speaker may not genuinely believe in the validity of such a dichotomy, pointing to a deeper critique of how justice is perceived.

The dismissive tone, especially with ""completely full of ****,"" suggests annoyance rather than playful irony or mocking.

Step 2: The true intention seems to be a serious rebuttal to what the writer perceives as a misinterpretation of their mathematical arguments. The speaker is attempting to clarify that their post was not meant to mock but rather to present factual information. While there is a hint of disdain in phrases like ""rather than actually looking"" and ""assumed what you wanted to believe,"" it does not indicate a clear, overt sarcasm but rather expresses genuine frustration with the other person's lack of understanding.

**Step 2:** The true intention suggests a layer of irony: by stating ""rather unsurprisingly,"" the speaker subtly mocks the idea that someone might think the U.S. Constitution affects Australian law. The rhetorical devices indicate a critique of naive assumptions, suggesting a more sarcastic undertone.

Keywords like ""too bad"" and ""doesn't interest me"" indicate a negative response.

Step 2: The true intention seems to convey a sarcastic tone, especially through phrases such as ""Good luck with anyone who wants to debate your topic,"" which sounds condescending.

These indicators reflect negative sentiment towards the issue at hand, suggesting a sense of frustration or ridicule.

### Step 2: True Intention Analysis

This irony reveals the speaker's critical stance regarding gun violence in the US, and rather than genuinely celebrating American culture, it highlights a sarcastic disapproval. The phrase ""the good old gun-crazy US of A"" operates as a critique, suggesting that the speaker is more disillusioned than celebratory about the country's approach to gun ownership and violence.

- Agent 2 also identified the sentiment as sarcastic, highlighting its critical nature. Final Label:",1
So god is unnatural?,1,"Step 1: The sentence ""So god is unnatural?"" includes the keyword ""unnatural,"" which implies a negative connotation. The phrasing suggests confusion or incredulity, indicating a potential sarcastic sentiment.

Step 2: Analyzing the sentence further, it challenges the traditional understanding of God as ""natural,"" using the term ""unnatural"" that traditionally applies to man-made or artificial elements. This juxtaposition implies irony since God, a typically revered figure, is being described in an unflattering manner. The rhetorical structure invites the reader to reflect on normative beliefs, indicating a critical and possibly mocking intent rather than a straightforward inquiry.

Step 3: The votes from the agents indicate a strong consensus that the sentence carries sarcasm, with all three agents identifying irony in its language. 

Final summary: Questioning God's nature ironically.

So you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an Uzi and carry it into a federal court house or school as long as he does not commit a crime? Wow.   And your logic about taking criminals off the street and then having no gun control concerns would be perfect...if we had a finite number of criminals. We don't. New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day.,1,"**Step 1:** The surface sentiment includes words and phrases that indicate disbelief and criticism, such as ""Wow,"" and the extreme examples of a child buying an Uzi. The overall tone suggests a disdainful attitude toward the idea being critiqued.  

**Step 2:** Upon analyzing the sentence closely, it becomes clear that the author is employing rhetorical devices like irony and hyperbole to stress the ridiculousness of their argument against lax gun control. The exaggeration of a child's capacity to wield such a dangerous weapon underscores the absurdity of the position held by proponents of unrestricted gun access. Hence, the true intention here is to critique the flawed logic surrounding gun rights and crime prevention humorously.  

**Step 3:** The final labels, based on the analysis from all Agents, unanimously indicate sarcasm embedded within a critique of flawed policies. Therefore, the summary indicates that the statement reflects a sarcastic assessment of a serious issue.

"Is that what you said right before they started banning assault weapons? 'Oh, let's just see what Sarah Brady wants to do?' Obviously, you're gullible. Since you're such a brainiac and all, why don't you visit the UN website and see what your beloved UN is up to?   And again, read this slower this time (if that helps) 'On the other hand, not one acceptable reason for individuals owning guns is mentioned.'",1,"Step 1: The SURFACE sentiment in the text features derogatory terms like ""gullible,"" ""brainiac,"" and phrases that indicate mockery (""if that helps""). The overall tone suggests criticism and sarcasm regarding opinions on gun regulations, leading to a negative sentiment toward the addressed individual.

Step 2: The TRUE intention of the sentence appears to be a critique of someone's intelligence and reasoning regarding gun ownership. The sarcastic remarks and rhetorical questions create an ironic tone, suggesting that the speaker believes the addressed party is naïve or misinformed about gun regulations. The phrases imply that the speaker does not take the other person's stance seriously and sees it as lacking valid justification.

Step 3: In summary, all three agents conclude that the text conveys sarcasm through condescension and irony. Therefore, the final determination based on their assessments is a strong indication of satire.

Final Label: Sarcastic commentary on gun regulations. [1]",1
"What quaint illogic. Only people who marry can get divorced, so a reduction in people marrying has no effect on rising divorce rates. If anything, a rising divorce rate among fewer marriages points to an even higher divorce rate than ""normal"".",1,"**Step 1:** The surface sentiment of the text indicates criticism and mockery, especially with phrases like ""quaint illogic,"" suggesting disdain for simplistic reasoning. Emphasis on contradictions in logic adds to this sentiment. 

**Step 2:** The true intention of the sentence emerges as a critique of a commonly held logical fallacy surrounding marriage and divorce. Phrases such as ""rising divorce rate among fewer marriages"" imply an illogical stance while using irony to underscore the critique. The mocking tone reinforces the sarcastic nature, revealing an intention to highlight the absurdity of the argument being presented.

**Step 3:** Based on the analysis of the surface sentiment and the underlying intention, all agents indicate a consistent conclusion towards sarcasm directed at flawed reasoning. Thus, the voting results align: Agent1 (1), Agent2 (1), Agent3 (1).

"Wow, you PROVED the Big Bang to be a big dud? I didn't see this clear refutation of a longheld scientific theory written up in any of the peer reviewed scientific journals. I must have overlooked it. Can you give the reference to your article?",1,"Step 1: The surface sentiment of the statement uses words like ""PROVED,"" ""big dud,"" and phrases indicating disbelief. The tone suggests mockery toward someone's claim about the Big Bang, highlighting skepticism.

Step 2: The true intention behind the statement is sarcastic disbelief. The exaggerated praise of the achievement (""you PROVED"") paired with the dismissal of the scientific theory as a ""big dud"" indicates the speaker is not genuinely accepting the claim. The request for a reference reinforces the mockery, as it implies there is no credible evidence backing the assertion.

Step 3: Based on the analysis from the agents and our deductions, all indicators point toward a sarcastic interpretation. Therefore, we summarize this analysis as ""sarcastic disbelief in scientific claim.""

So are you saying that the people of India aren't upset about what happened and how the police chose to hide instead of engage the enemy and thus let hundreds of people be violently murdered? Are you saying that the people of India aren't seeking changes so they can arm themselves accordingly so if something like this happens again they'll be better prepared to handle it?,1,"**Step 1:** The surface sentiment reveals strong emotional weight, particularly through phrases like ""let hundreds of people be violently murdered."" This indicates outrage and concern rather than indifference. 

**Step 2:** The true intention of the statement is to highlight the absurdity and negligence of the police response to a violent event, contrasting with the expected outrage from the populace. The rhetorical questions serve to challenge the premise that people are apathetic, suggesting a more critical and engaged reaction instead. 

**Step 3:** Based on the analysis from the agents and the logical deduction of the surface sentiment and true intention, the majority consensus indicates sarcasm and critical reflection on societal apathy. The final summary is: ""Questions absurdity of apathy and inaction.""

Dear Mr. Criminal,   Which house would you like to break into.   SIncerely,   1 constitutional rights violator and 1 law abiding citizen.",1,"Step 1: The surface sentiment of the text suggests a boastful pride in preparedness for home defense with firearms. The use of terms related to weaponry (M4, ACOG scope, etc.) conveys seriousness, but there's an underlying irony when contrasting that with the absurdity of typical home defense (rechargeable phone, fancy pug).

Step 2: The true intention behind the text reveals a sarcastic critique of over-preparation. The hyperbolic portrayal of oneself as overly armed for defense, juxtaposed with “VoR” who supposedly has minimal defenses (a phone and a pug), implies a humorous skepticism of both extremes—keenness for security versus an ironic reflection on modern defensiveness. The tone oscillates between pride in military readiness and ridicule of insufficient security measures.

Step 3: The final labels come from Agent 1, Agent 2, and Agent 3, all agreeing that this is satirical in nature. The consistent theme across their analyses involves humor derived from exaggerated comparisons of home defense strategies, leading to a unanimous vote.

Everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best. There's no law that says people can't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis. 'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.",1,"**Step 1:** The SURFACE sentiment appears critical, utilizing phrases like ""Bull"" and rhetorical questions. This suggests a tone of disbelief and challenge rather than neutrality. 

**Step 2:** The TRUE intention of the text seems to mock the claim that one can avoid judging others based on moral standards, employing sarcasm to illustrate its arguments. The rhetorical questions serve to undermine the opposing perspective, implying that the speaker finds the notion absurd. 

**Step 3:** In voting, Agent1 and Agent2 lean toward a non-sarcastic label [0], while Agent3 clearly identifies sarcasm [1]. Given the evidence from Agent3 about the tone and constructed language suggesting mockery, the overall judgment leans towards sarcasm.

You supplied that because it is foolish to claim otherwise. That's what I mean when I say that you reject parts of the Bible that you see as foolish. When you have accepted the evidence that the Bible is in error (4 legs on a grasshopper, sun at center of solar system, rabbits chewing cud, an unmoving earth) you add elements that aren't in the Bible and declare it without error.   You ""interpret"" and then claim that you are reading it literally. Pick one and go with it. You seem to claim that you accept the Bible literally and then add whatever you feel is necessary to make it rational.",1,"Step 1: The surface sentiment of the text appears to be critical, especially towards the literal interpretation of the Bible. Words like ""foolish,"" ""reject,"" and ""inconsistent"" indicate a negative tone. 

Step 2: The true intention behind the passage is to mock the inconsistencies found in a literal interpretation of biblical texts. The author uses irony by contrasting the supposed consistent acceptance of scripture with the selective interpretation that accommodates modern science. The rhetorical devices employed, such as sarcasm and irony, suggest the author is not just critiquing but also exposing the absurdity in the arguments presented.

Step 3: The three agents collectively suggest a strong satirical element present in the text: Agent 1 and Agent 2 both identify critical tones, while Agent 3 specifically notes the use of irony.

Did you get another cracker polly?,1,"Step 1: The surface sentiment of the sentence ""Did you get another cracker, Polly?"" appears to be neutral, with no clear indicators of sarcasm such as exaggerated phrases, tone indicators, or emotive language. The question seems straightforward, inquiring about a simple action—getting another cracker.

Step 2: However, upon deeper analysis, Agent3 points out that there might be a layer of sarcasm or irony due to the phrasing and cultural references involved (e.g., the phrase ""Polly wants a cracker""). This suggests a mocking tone or trivializing a situation that may not be as noteworthy as it seems. The reference could indicate that the speaker is implying something about Polly that isn't meant to be taken seriously, contesting her actions with a touch of humor.

Step 3: Considering the variability in results from the agents, there’s a split opinion. Agent1 and Agent2 lean towards the conclusion that it is non-sarcastic, while Agent3 interprets it as sarcastic. After evaluating the arguments, the final label seems to suggest that while there are elements indicating possible sarcasm, the intent of the original question does not strongly indicate sarcasm.

"There are a few slight problems with that theory. First of all the evidence fits perfectly with that book you speak of. If predicts that all creatures came about suddenly and completely formed.

That is all that has ever been observed in the history of the world.   It predicts that recorded human history will be less that 10k years. That is what we observe.   It predicts that man has always been intelligent and ancient language and buildings confirm this.   It predicts that billions of fossils will be found in rock laid down by water all over the world, this we have observed.   It predicts there will be pathways in the sea, this is so.   It predicts that the heating of the air will create wind and this is so.   It predicts that the sea is the source of rain and it is so.   It predicted 800 years in advance that the Messiah the King would ride in to erusalem on a donkey to the exact day . That He would be crucified and his side pierced with a spear and cry out My God , My God why has thou forsaken me ?and it was so. It was predicted the ones who crucified him would cast lots for his garments and they did. That three days later He would rise from the dead and He did.   That DNA mutates does not prove anything other that it mutates. It is almost always harrmul or fatal and has never been observed to change one kind of an animal into another.   That the species that adapt to their environment survive and those that don't die is a self evident truth not evidence. About as intellectually stimulating as saying most things who fail to survive die.   Fossils exist. Now that is a brilliant statement. Why not say , water exist , or sand is?   All dating methods are based on circular logic. If the date agrees with the theory it is correct , if not it must be contaminated. It is based on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much has decayed when compared to the rate of decay gives us a date. Fortunately we already knew the earth was very old or evolution could not have occured. We know how old fossils are because of the rocks they are in and how old the rocks are by the fossils in the rocks. If the 2 are in the wrong place then we know there was an overthrust which is basically a miracle from God which is allowed because evolution needs it.

That would be senseless.",1,"Step 1: The surface sentiment expresses a strong critique of evolutionary theory and its proponents, using phrases that suggest disdain, such as ""brilliant deduction"" and ""You are on a roll.""
