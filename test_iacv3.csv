"This past Saturday, my partner and I had a commitment ceremony or wedding if you say care to say.....In my state it is not legally bindingm we did it anyway.....it was more about the emotional commitment two people make to each other in the presence of their friends and family. I tried so hard not to, but when the celebrant asked me to repeat after him, with the vows I wrote my self.....I tried and tried and tried, but couldn't speak. I was too moved by the moment and all I could do was cry....   I love my partner with all my heart....So I wanted to get through, I thought about our taxes (didn't work). So thought about everyone in their underware.....contrary to popular opinoin that doesn't work either.....   I managed to get the words out (don't know how) just did!   This marriage is just as perfect to us, and those that were our witnessess.....as any heterosexual wedding......   The rest of the night was blur, between 50 people wanting my attention and me being really buzzed on white wine.....oh my oh my.......I was pretty shocked!   Marrige is what you decide it is, regardles if the gov was to see it....I am now married.....like it or not.",0

"And certain versions of Mark:   15He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. 16Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 17And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 18they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.�?

"Actually there are already a couple floating around. One fascinating one: Gaia theory and the Daisyworld model. It's all around self-organising systems and the earth as a self-regulating system/organsism/something or other. James Lovelock and co. Interesting to read but sometimes feels a little too 'lets-all-just-get-along' to be real, hard-core theory.   Either way, it's probably a lot more likely to be accepted than creationism, should evolutionism for some reason be disproved.",0
"Well, Google is your friend here - try fossil and see what you get. Alternatively click the link in my sig and look in the archive section at Talk Origins.   It is not possible to break fossilisation down into such simple notions as ""one big preservation event"" and lots of ""little preservations"". If you can think of some examples of fossils then we can examine them more specifically as what can be said about the circumstances of their preservation.   I've been a bit vague here as it is a) such a broad subject to describe succinctly b) I'm tired and c) I'm full of cold   No doubt someone who isn't under the influence of b) and/or c) will chime in as well with more details while I pull round.

The stranger coming in and sitting down and using your plates and eating your food is a direct consequences of you inventing him in for dinner.   -If you say you don't want the unborn to ""live off you"" anymore then the only thing you can do is starve it because you can't kill it as it did nothing that it was not allowed to do until just now.   -You have decided the stranger must go, however, you don't have a right to kill him right there as you didn't give him any reasonable time to leave.",0
"1. From what I have learned, different locations breed different surroundings. Human ancestors were migratory pack animals. Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time.   2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures. Some mutations also occured etc. Things like that.   Evolution doesn't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium. Not everyting is always changing, as far as I learned. Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.   Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example. They have 98% the same DNA as Humans. They are the closest to HOmo Sapien.   3. Niches. Related to above. Crocs, for example, don't evolve that much because they are a very successful animal design and they found a place in which they can thrive for generations with little to no changes. Other animals can do the same.   4. As well, humans didn't come directly from Apes. We all evolved from a common ancestor who did all of the above.   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/species.html   Here is a time line of hominid species   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html   Evolution doesn't lead to a higher species, as well. There is no hierarchy in nature. Each species is equally as well ""evolved"" depending on it's environment etc.   A Human is no more evolved than a Chimp or better than a Chimp. Evolution doesn't lead to progression, but merely change. It's not getting better toward some high standard. Humans just like to think so.",0

"I see a subtle distinction here. Creationism is concerned with the spiritual origins of people. ""Evolutionism"" is entirely concerned with explaining the nature and history of the physical world.

FFS, if you are going to use a source, have one that at least has the history of the theory right?   Yes, the estimated age of the universe changed over time. We got increasingly more sophisticated ways to measure it. In the last 30 years, the age estimate has not significantly changed, but the +/- has narrowed drastically. Do try to use a source that isn't over 30 years old.",0

"Yes, that's all true, and it makes complete sense. But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples. Now you have same-sex couples who are legally married and same-sex couples who cannot be legally married in the same state, which can be argued to be denial of equal protection of the laws. I don't know....it could be interesting. Maybe things won't play out this way. We'll have to wait and see.",0
"i'm impressed! this is a very precise description, in regular english   and yes, the deduction in 9 seems presumptious if all we state is God has a ""possibility of existence"". how this was cleverly cleared up (from the same source site) was simply a trip back to the definition: ""greatest possible being"". the ""greatest possible being"", by definition, MUST have a possible existence. in otherwords, we cannot assume that there is a possibility that the greatest possible being does not exist. yeah, it sounds like the whole ""proof"" is pointless because your premise is already the proof   just keep in mind that for the purposes of this proof, God is defined as ""the greatest being possible"". as long as that definition is maintained, the proof works...   does that mean that God exists? hmmm....",0

"There are a few slight problems with that theory. First of all the evidence fits perfectly with that book you speak of. If predicts that all creatures came about suddenly and completely formed. This is all we have ever observed. The earliest creatures -according to your theories dating- had incredibly formed eyes etc. and no ancestors among the fossils   It also predicts that animals will produce the same kind of animals , this is all that has ever in the history of the world been observed.   +It predicts the heavens will show a perfect order and can be used for signs and for seasons and for days and for years. That is all that has ever been observed in the history of the world.   It predicts that recorded human history will be less that 10k years. That is what we observe.   It predicts that man has always been intelligent and ancient language and buildings confirm this.   It predicts that billions of fossils will be found in rock laid down by water all over the world, this we have observed.   It predicts there will be pathways in the sea, this is so.   It predicts that the heating of the air will create wind and this is so.   It predicts that the sea is the source of rain and it is so.   It predicted 800 years in advance that the Messiah the King would ride in to erusalem on a donkey to the exact day . That He would be crucified and his side pierced with a spear and cry out My God , My God why has thou forsaken me ?and it was so. It was predicted the ones who crucified him would cast lots for his garments and they did. That three days later He would rise from the dead and He did.   That DNA mutates does not prove anything other that it mutates. It is almost always harrmul or fatal and has never been observed to change one kind of an animal into another.   That the species that adapt to their environment survive and those that don't die is a self evident truth not evidence. About as intellectually stimulating as saying most things who fail to survive die.   Fossils exist. Now that is a brilliant statement. Why not say , water exist , or sand is?   All dating methods are based on circular logic. If the date agrees with the theory it is correct , if not it must be contaminated. It is based on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much has decayed when compared to the rate of decay gives us a date. Fortunately we already knew the earth was very old or evolution could not have occured. We know how old fossils are because of the rocks they are in and how old the rocks are by the fossils in the rocks. If the 2 are in the wrong place then we know there was an overthrust which is basically a miracle from God which is allowed because evolution needs it.   Life forms in the millions so therefore it must has started out as a random bunch of chemicals that created itself on a planet that created itself and evolved into the millions we see now. Another brilliant deduction. You are on a roll.   Believe our eyes. Oh you must mean all those times you are walking down the beach and trip all over the lobe finned fish coming on shore for the first time.
